# Contributing

All contributions to Phiki are welcome and greatly appreciated, regardless of their size or set of changes.

To make sure your pull request is reviewed and treated fairly, please follow the rules below:
* Keep your contribution small and self-contained. Don't make large changes to multiple parts of the project at the same time.
* Keep your branch up-to-date with `main` to make it easier to review and merge.
* Keep your commits clean and simple. Some reviewers will work through each commit to see what has changed and why.
* Always check the "Issues" tab before working on something new. If there's an issue, it could contain valuable information or ideas for the contribution.
